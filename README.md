# imgvoid

**imgvoid**  is an experimental toolkit that demonstrates how images can safely act as carriers of digital information. Designed for educational and creative purposes, it provides multiple methods to bind URLs into images without hiding harmful code. With support for clickable HTML wrappers, QR code overlays, and EXIF metadata storage, imgvoid shows practical techniques for linking visuals to external resources. It also includes a simple steganography demo to illustrate how data can be embedded in pixel structures. This project is ideal for students, educators, and researchers exploring digital watermarking, steganography basics, and creative uses of image-based information sharing.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Clickable Image Links (HTML)**
  - Turn any image into a hyperlink inside a webpage.
  - Outputs lightweight HTML snippets.

- **QR Code Binding**
  - Embed a URL as a QR code overlay on an image.
  - Style options: corner placement, opacity control, or blended watermark.

- **Metadata Binding (EXIF)**
  - Store links inside an imageâ€™s EXIF metadata.
  - Supports writing + extracting the hidden link.

- **Educational Steganography (Optional)**
  - Demonstrates hiding text links inside pixel data (least significant bits).
  - Emphasis on *learning about information security concepts*, not malicious use.
